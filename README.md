# Same Multiplicities

My solution to a problem I solved on codewards (Are they the "same"? https://www.codewars.com/kata/550498447451fbbd7600041c)

Kata description taken from the problem:
Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.
